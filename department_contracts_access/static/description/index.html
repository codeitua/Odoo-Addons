                    <li>choosing a User the Employee's Contracts should be shared with;</li>
                    <li>choosing if the access to the Contract of the Department Manager should be shared;</li>
                    <li>choosing an expiration date till when the access is shared and providing infinite access if no expiration date is specified;</li>
                    <li>seeing a list of all the sharing records with the possibility to delete the record and thus revoke the access sharing.</li>
                </ul>
            </span>
