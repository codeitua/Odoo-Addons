The module allows:

- to choose the Department whose Employees’ Contracts you want to share;
- to choose a user the Employees’ Contracts should be shared with;
- to choose if the access to a contract of the Department Manager should be shared;
- to choose an Expiration date till when the Contracts' access is shared;
- to see a list of all the sharing records with the possibility to delete the record and thus revoke the access sharing.

4. Activate the Developer Mode;
5. Go to Apps and push the “Update Apps List” button;
